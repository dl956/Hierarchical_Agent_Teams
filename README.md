# Hierarchical_Agent_Teams
This project is a multi-agent research and writing system built with LangGraph and FastAPI. It organizes specialized agents—such as web search, web scraping, note taking, document writing, and chart generation—into teams managed by supervisor nodes. The system can receive user queries via a streaming WebSocket API and coordinates agent actions.

## Overview

Hierarchical Agent Teams is an end-to-end research and writing automation system  https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/hierarchical_agent_teams/
. It organizes specialized agents (web search, scraping, note taking, document writing, chart generation) into hierarchical teams managed by supervisor nodes. The system provides real-time interaction via a FastAPI backend and a Vue 3 frontend interface.

---

## Architecture

### Backend (Python)
- **FastAPI**: Provides APIs and WebSocket streaming for real-time interaction.
- **LangGraph + LangChain**: Builds and manages hierarchical agent teams as state graphs.
- **OpenAI GPT models**: Used for team agent intelligence (via `langchain_openai`).
- **Async Task Handling**: Uses asyncio for message streaming and agent output collection.
- **Tools**: Modular tools for search, web scraping, outline creation, document writing/editing, Python code execution, etc.

### Frontend (Vue 3)
- **Vue 3 (Single File Component: `App.vue`)**: Responsive UI for user input, flow display, file management, and real-time streaming via WebSocket.
- **File List**: Displays generated files, allows refreshing and downloading.
- **Flow Area**: Shows message flow from user and various agents with avatars, supports dark mode/theme switching.
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication with backend agents.

---

## Features

- **Hierarchical Agents**: Supervisor nodes delegate tasks to research teams (search, scrape) and writing teams (note taking, writing, charting).
- **Streaming Output**: Real-time agent message streaming to frontend.
- **Flexible File Generation**: Agents can read, write, edit, and present files (txt, md, images, etc.) in the workspace.
- **Interactive Web UI**: Submit queries, view agent flows, download files, and manage dark/light themes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Backend
- Python 3.8+
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [LangGraph](https://langgraph.org/)
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- (Dependencies installable via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

#### Frontend
- Node.js 14+
- npm (Node package manager)
- Vue 3

---

### Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dl956/Hierarchical_Agent_Teams.git
cd Hierarchical_Agent_Teams
```

**Backend Setup:**

1. Copy your OpenAI API key to a `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
2. Install python requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

**Frontend Setup:**

```bash
cd frontend/agent-teams-frontend
npm install
npm run serve
# Usually served at http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage

- Open the web frontend.
- Input your research or writing query.
- Agents collaborate automatically (search, scrape, note, write, chart).
- Watch the flow of agent actions and outputs in real time.
- Download any file generated by agents from the file area.

---

## Main File Structure

- `main.py`: FastAPI backend entry. Manages WebSocket, file management endpoints.
- `collector.py`: Async message queue collector for agent streaming output.
- `graph.py`: Builds hierarchical state graphs for agent team orchestration.
- `node.py`: Defines individual agent nodes and supervisor logic.
- `tools.py`: Implements tools for search, scraping, outlining, document/file operations, and Python code execution.
- `frontend/agent-teams-frontend/App.vue`: Main Vue component for interactive UI.
