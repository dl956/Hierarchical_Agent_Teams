# Hierarchical_Agent_Teams
This project is a multi-agent research and writing system built with LangGraph and FastAPI. It organizes specialized agents—such as web search, web scraping, note taking, document writing, and chart generation—into teams managed by supervisor nodes. The system can receive user queries via a streaming WebSocket API and coordinates agent actions.
